Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare Data

Description
Overview
In this project, we make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Statistics Computed

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day
#2 Popular stations and trip
